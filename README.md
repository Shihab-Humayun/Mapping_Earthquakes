# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Summary
This project deals with 3 different deliverables.

The first deliverable is to add Tectonic Plate Data. Using knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, I added tectonic plate data using d3.json(), added the data using the geoJSON() layer, set the tectonic plate LineString data to stand out on the map, and added the tectonic plate data to the overlay object with the earthquake data.

The second deliverable is to Major Earthquake Data. Using  knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data, I added major earthquake data to the map using d3.json(), and a color and set the radius of the circle based on the magnitude of earthquake, and added a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer, geoJSON().

The third deliverable is to add an additional map. Using knowledge of JavaScript and Leaflet.js I added a third map style to the earthquake map.
